#### *Designing intelligent, governed, and scalable enterprise data products using Databricks, Unity Catalog, and AI-powered pipelines — aligned with McDonald’s global omni-channel strategy.*

## Repository Overview 

##### McDonald’s operates one of the most complex global omni-channel enterprises in the world — spanning in-restaurant POS, drive-thru, mobile apps, kiosks, delivery platforms, customer support, and global franchises.

This repository demonstrates how a Principal Enterprise Architect can:

- Bridge the gaps between Data, Software/Microservices, and AI teams
- Design AI-infused enterprise data pipelines
- Govern data at scale using Unity Catalog
- Enable omni-channel customer intelligence
- Apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to enterprise data products
- Translate raw, unstructured signals into business-ready intelligence

While the role itself may not neccessarily be hands-on coding, this repo proves architectural depth across:

- Enterprise data platforms

- Cloud-native patterns

- AI integration

- Governance & compliance

- Cross-domain collaboration
